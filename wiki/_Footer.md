I am an Automation Engineer by day. By night, I crusade the town serving a cold dish of vigilante justice. My mission is to rid the world of bad UX practices, desktop-first design, poor testing systems and unscalable solutions alike. My hobbies include reading, writing, coding and playing the drums.

> I follow the latest standards in W3C HTML, CSS, and Javascript development and believe in clean and minimal code.
